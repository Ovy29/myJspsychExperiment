This is a psychology experiment

**Experiment Name:** Visual Categorization Reaction Time Experiment Based on Color and Shape

**Introduction:** This experiment aims to explore individuals' visual categorization reaction times to color and shape information. The experiment utilizes a computerized platform built with the jsPsych library to present visual stimuli and collect keypress responses in a responsive web-based experimental setting. Participants will categorize the presented patterns on the screen based on color or shape through keypress responses.

**Purpose of the Experiment:**

1. To measure individuals' perceptual and categorization reaction times to color and shape information.
2. To study the impact of different stimulus features (color and shape) on reaction times.
3. To investigate the potential effects of task switching on reaction time and accuracy.

**Experimental Procedure:**

1. **Introduction to the Experiment:** Participants will receive detailed instructions on the experimental process and task requirements.
2. **Fixation Point Presentation:** A "+" sign will be presented on the screen before the experiment starts to ensure participants focus on the center of the screen.
3. **Blank Screen:** A brief period of a blank screen to prepare for stimulus presentation.
4. **Judgment Task:** Participants will view a pattern with a combination of color and shape and judge the color or shape of the pattern based on the current and previously presented letter.
5. **Keypress Response:** The "F" key indicates green or circle, and the "J" key indicates red or triangle.
6. **Task Rules:** If the current letter is the same as the last one presented, judge the color; if different, judge the shape.
7. **Experiment Repetition:** Repeat the above process until all trials are completed.

**Experimental Equipment:**

- Computer or tablet with a modern web browser.
- Stable internet connection.

**Materials:**

- A series of patterns with combinations of color and shape.
- Keypress response collection system.

**Methodology:**

- Participants will be randomly assigned to different experimental conditions.
- Each trial includes a judgment task for the color or shape of the pattern.
- Reaction times and accuracy will be recorded for data analysis.

**Results:** The results will be analyzed from the following perspectives:

1. **Reaction Time:** Analysis of the average reaction times for color and shape judgment tasks.
2. **Accuracy:** Calculation of the correctness of participants' judgments.
3. **Task Switching Costs:** Comparison of reaction times and accuracy differences when switching between different task types.

**Data Analysis:**

- Data analysis will be conducted using statistical software.
- Methods such as repeated measures ANOVA or t-tests will be used to assess the impact of experimental conditions on results.

**Expected Results:** It is expected that there will be differences in reaction times for color and shape judgment tasks, and task switching may lead to prolonged reaction times and decreased accuracy.

**Precautions:**

- Please ensure that the experiment is conducted in a quiet environment with appropriate lighting.
- Keep your gaze focused on the screen during the experiment.
- If you experience any discomfort, please notify the experimenter immediately.

**Conclusion:** This experiment will provide an in-depth understanding of the processing of color and shape information in visual categorization tasks, offering valuable data support for the fields of cognitive psychology and human-computer interaction.
